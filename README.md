Needs Pygame

Generates a 'train network' from a random selection of points which represent towns and displays the result.
The aim is for the network to be somewhat representative of the UK train network, with more track connecting larger towns and 
for there to be effectively 'main lines' and few loops. This was mostly successful.
Also creates some 'services' which represent train journeys through the network, and 'passengers' who would like to go from one town
to another through the network.
